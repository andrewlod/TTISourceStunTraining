First run the "Increase TCP Buffer Size..." batch file or else the AI server will crash.
Copy the Panda3d folder provided to the root of your C: drive, or use the installer (separate download check root directory).
Install python-2.7 included
Install Visual Studio Express (vns_full)

Once all that is done, run the astron server, then uberdog (press enter on basechannel prompt), then run AI server (press enter on both prompts).

You must figure out the rest (login tokens etc) Localhost client should work.  The websites api files are included but will need some tweaking.  So will toontown/toonbase/ToontownStartRemote.py.
Please note that you will need an appropriate php server such as apache to serve php requests.


IF YOU ARE ONLY RUNNING A CLIENT YOU DO NOT HAVE TO INSTALL "vns_full" OR RUN THE TCP BUFFER PATCH
